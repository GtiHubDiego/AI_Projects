In this project, I have combined the knowledge learned in 2 different Udemy courses 
( "YOLO v3 for Objects Detection"  and "Face Recognition Web App with Machine Learning in Flask") 
to create a simple webapp for Objects Detection in real time where we use the webcam and
an already trained YOLO v3 algorithm for that purpose.
