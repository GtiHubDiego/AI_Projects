In this project we will be able to move the mouse (left, right) using the movement of our eyes.

1) I have created a CNN model with my own dataset ( pictures of my eyes looking to different direcctions) and I have train it.
2) I have used cvzone-mediapipe libraries for face detection.
3) I have taken a frame just with the eyes which I have used for predict (on my CNN) the movement of the eyes.
4) I have used autopy library for mouse movements and Keys class for clicking a keyboard key (virtually), 
which we will open a world of possibilities such a play games just using the movement of your eyes.


Moving the mouse and pressing keys ('l' (left) and 'r' (right) ) :
