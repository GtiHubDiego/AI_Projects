# Color detection
### In this proyect I've created a Python program using OpenCV library that allows the detection of a specific color on a frame. (blue by default)

To make it funnier, we are using the color detection in real time using a webcam, and once we detect the color selected we create a bounding box around the object
that contains the color and we track it (or them).

We can customize the color selected in real time as well. I have created trackbars for this porpose where we can select a low and hight range of RGB colours.

RGB ranges for blue
